 <b> Week 2: Paper Lantern/Accordion Book/Tessellating Object/??? </b> <br>

At first, I was interested in creating a lasercut version of a millipede, but I wasn't very invested in the idea to begin with, and after lasercutting a failed prototype, I began brainstorming other ideas. <br>
<br>

I still wanted something that was maybe aesthetically similar to the way millipedes are segmented - I was also very inspired by book and tessellation paper artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/buchundpapier/">Nadine Werner<a/> and decided I wanted to create some sort of modular accordion book that, one that would have a pleasing design when folded flat and when completely extended. <br> <br>

I've worked with the program Rhino before in graduate school to create Illustration files to be lasercut - it's a program I most familiar with for 2D processes (plus I have a license for it), so this week I worked mostly with Rhino and also very scrappily figured out how 3D modeling works in that program. <br>
