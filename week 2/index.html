 <b> Week 2: Accordion Book/Paper Lantern/Tessellating Object/??? </b> <br>

At first, I was interested in creating a lasercut version of a millipede, but I wasn't very invested in the idea to begin with, and after lasercutting a failed prototype... I began brainstorming other ideas. <br>
<br>

I still wanted something that was maybe aesthetically similar to the way millipedes are segmented and was also very inspired by book and tessellation paper artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/buchundpapier/">Nadine Werner<a/>. I decided to create some sort of modular accordion style object that would have pleasing designs when folded flat and completely extended, and could be connected differently for a slightly different form. I also chose paper for its flexibility compared to matboard or cardboard. <br> <br>

The idea was that a singular shape could be configured in different ways - I liked the idea that two of the shapes could form a lantern style form, but that they could also be stacked alternatively or like a ladder on top of one another.  <br>

<br>
I've worked with the program Rhino before in graduate school to create Illustration files to be lasercut on matboard and wood - it's a program I most familiar with for 2D processes (plus I have a license for it), so this week I worked mostly with Rhino and also very scrappily figured out how 3D modeling works in that program. I set three layers color coded RBG - one black, one red, one blue. The black layer for laser cutting purposes is meant for rastering (etches on the surface of your material, very good for bitmapped images, etc), but I used that layer as a rough sketchup of what I wanted. The red will cut completely through your material, and the blue will engrave on the surface of your material. <br>

<b> First Iteration </b> <br>

My first attempt, I was more concerned with the kerf. I wanted slots in the paper so that the arms of the object could connect through there, but I was worried that even the singular line made by the laser cutter would be too wide of a slot. The paper I used (Rives BFK, 320 gsm) was 0.39mm, so it ended up being a bit too difficult to fit the arms into the slots - since the slots are extremely close to the edge of the object, some of them tore when trying to fit the pieces together. <br>

<br>

I then made the width of the slot 0.01mm, so that essentially the laser cutter would go over that red cut line twice and widen the slot ever so slightly - not too much that the paper would slip out, but just wide enough so fitting the pieces was less time consuming. <br>

<br>
I think there are a lot of improvements I can make to this - particularly figuring out a sturdier connection, (a curved shape, similar to the clasp on takeout boxes?), possibly shortening the length of the slots so the edges of the hexagon are stronger, but for now, it is functional. 

As a side bonus, when the pieces are connected in a circle, it folds in on itself very similar to a how a <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Fold-a-Hexaflexagon">Hexaflexagon<a/> folds. Which is cool, but also hilariously unfortunate because I have no idea how I did it hahaha
