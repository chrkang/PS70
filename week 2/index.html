 <b> Week 2: Accordion Book/Paper Lantern/Tessellating Object/??? </b> <br>

At first, I was interested in creating a lasercut version of a millipede, but I wasn't very invested in the idea to begin with, and after lasercutting a failed prototype... I began brainstorming other ideas. <br>
<br>

I still wanted something that was maybe aesthetically similar to the way millipedes are segmented and was also very inspired by book and tessellation paper artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/buchundpapier/">Nadine Werner<a/>. I decided to create some sort of modular accordion style object that would have pleasing designs when folded flat and completely extended, and could be connected differently for a slightly different form. I also chose paper for its flexibility compared to matboard or cardboard. <br> <br>

I've worked with the program Rhino before in graduate school to create Illustration files to be lasercut on matboard and wood - it's a program I most familiar with for 2D processes (plus I have a license for it), so this week I worked mostly with Rhino and also very scrappily figured out how 3D modeling works in that program. <br>

<br>

<br>
The idea was that a singular shape could be configured in different ways - I liked the idea that two of the shapes could form a lantern style form, but that they could also be stacked alternatively or like a ladder on top of one another. <br>

<b> First Iteration </b> <br>

My first attempt, I was more concerned with the kerf. I wanted slots in the paper so that the arms of the object could connect through there, but I was worried that even the singular line made by the laser cutter would be too wide of a slot. The paper I used (Rives BFK, 320 gsm) was 0.39mm, so it ended up being a bit too difficult to fit the arms into the slots - since the slots are extremely close to the edge of the object, some of them tore when trying to fit the pieces together. <br>

<br>

I then made the width of the slot 0.01mm, so that essentially the laser cutter would go over that red cut line twice and widen the slot ever so slightly - not too much that the paper would slip out, but just wide enough so fitting the pieces was less time consuming. <br>

As a side bonus, I inadvertently made something very similar to a <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Fold-a-Hexaflexagon">Hexaflexagon<a/>. Which is cool, but also probably hilariously unfortunate because I have no idea how I did it hahaha
