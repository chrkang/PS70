 <b> Week 6: Inputs </b> <br>

I am rethinking my final project - well, just the electronic portions of it (still want to make a press) - wondering if I can do something with pressure - possibly measuring the amount of pressure the roller puts on the items on the press bed, and being able to adjust the press bed (lower/raise it)? Anyways, this week I tested out Arduino pressure sensors with homemade force sense resistors using velostat, copper tape, paper (successful) and matboard (not even close to successful). <br>

I spent a couple days with two main objectives: making a couple different versions of force sense resistors, and continuing to learn coding/understand C++ (I've been watching a lot of YouTube videos). The code I used for this project was taken from: 
 <a href="https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-force-sensor"> Arduinogetstarted.com</a>, with some edits made, including using millis() instead of delay() (Also I was not a fan of the constant pressure read out labels - editing the code so it outputted the numbers only made more sense to me and was easier to work with)

First I was trying to make my own force sense resistor using matboard, thinner foam, and velostat. After reading up more on the velostat, I realized my mistake with sandwiching the velostat inbetween two basically impossible to bend/manipulate slabs of matboard. <br>

<br> Then I came across <a href="https://embelashed.org/paper/sensors/pressure.html"> embelashed's</a> paper sensor... <br>
