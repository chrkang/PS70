 <b> Week 9: DIY LED Box, ala Yayoi Kusama if she was on a budget </b> <br>

This week was a group project (with Al and Anh). We pretty quickly decided to do something similar to one of the examples Nathan linked to <p><a href="https://elizabethgallardo.github.io/PHYSCI-70/Week%2010_%20Networking%20and%20Communication%20(IoT)/index.html">Ely's LED strip</a></p> in part because all 3 of us were not confident in our coding skills. <br>

The first part of the week, Al took on the task of setting up Firebase with the ESP-32 S2, Anh was working on wiring an example LED strip, and I was thinking of box structures and finding code snippets for us to work with (ended up going with a Fast.led example at the end due to...LED issues). <br>

Anh and I worked on getting the box assembled Wednesday/Thursday (Anh finished the wooden structure, I lasercut some acrylic mirror slabs I found randomly in my office (hopefully no one needs them at the CCVA, oops) and then I installed the LED strip backwards which led to about 3ish hours of failed troubleshooting by myself, then about 3 more with Anh and Ibrahim before we messaged Nathan who of course immediately solved it with A: a working power strip that can handle 120ish LED lights and B: switching the LED strip around). It's probably going to be funny 3 years from now (especially the part where I almost fried my laptop mid-troubleshooting). <br>
