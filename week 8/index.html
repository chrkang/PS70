 <b> Week 8: CNC, moldmaking </b> <br>

This week I made a prototype of the top part of the letterpress press. I also spent a long time making a 3D mold in Fusion for the wax mill, but Ibrahim and I could not figure it out in time, so I ended up making a mold of a walnut shell and paper pulp casting it with pink Post-It notes that I accidentally put through the wash (which softened it really well to be cast). <br>

 Measuring for the CNC was actually pretty straightforward - next time I may round up by .01 mm, but my pieces fit together fairly easily (just needed a mallet for the round pieces in the tube) with the straight measurements I took off of the calipers. <br>

 I used 3/4" scrap birch plywood from my work's scrap pile, which worked out pretty well. I double checked the wood to make sure there weren't any nails or other metal in there. <br>

 Assembling the pieces was also fairly quick but I ran into a small issue of me not being able to drill straight holes, so the outer circles holding the primary "roller" (currently cardboard tube) are wonky and affect the continuous roll. <br>

 Lastly, here's some screenshots of the 3D model I made in Fusion that I still want to wax mill: <br>
