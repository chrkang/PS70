 <b>#### Final Project Proposal(s) </b>

In general, my ideas for the final project revolve around different types of equipment for a small or at-home printmaking studio to do relief and etching processes that require little to no use of solvents or acids. <br>This equipment would likely be most helpful to people who <i> do </i> have access to academic/industry shops that have CNC routers/laser engravers/etc, but hopefully this would also be accessible to printmakers who do not have access to a print studio:

 <b>##### Automated Mezzotint Plate Rocker </b>

<i> Context: </i>

<sub> Example of a mezzotint (artist Erin Wohletz): </sub> <br> <img src="mezzotint example.jpg" alt="print" /img> 

Traditional mezzotints are created by using a  <a href="https://eclyons.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=12&products_id=263">specialized metal tool<a/>  to create a layer of rough indentations into a metal plate (typically copper) that will print completely opaque. <br> This is referred to as "rocking the plate" The roughened surface is then gone back into with burnishing tools to create lighter values. 

<a href="https://clarklibrary.ucla.edu/blog/seventeenth-century-printmaking-mezzotint/">Brief introduction/definition of the mezzotint process<a/> 

The prep-work to create a mezzotint print is painstakingly time-consuming - most mezzotint prints are small in scale as rocking even a small, 5" x 5" plate takes at least 3 hours.

Automated plate rocker where it will mechanically rotate the plate and move the rocker tool around to rock any size plate (that will fit on the base) - much like a slow cooker, you can set it and forget it. <br>

More thoughts: programming it to act on a timer, or rocking it in different types of patterns. Also possibly fabricating my own mezzotint rocker tool since the rocker tool is very expensive (~$200 for a 5" long rocker)

##### <b> Portable/Miniature Letterpress Proofing Press </b>

<img src="letterpress.jpg" alt="drawing of a diy letterpress press with built in drawers" /img> 

Portable letterpress proofing press. Some changes from the standard printing press that I'd like to explore:  adjustable bed that lowers or raises based on the height of what's placed on it (so it can print more than letterpress type), a larger diameter roller to get more pressure while printing. Built in drawers/storage for letterpress type.
